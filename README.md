# User Reading Analysis and Book Recommendation System

A Node.js application that analyzes user reading habits and recommends books using OpenAI's Assistant API and Snowflake database.

## Overview

This project connects to a Snowflake database to retrieve user reading history, analyzes reading patterns using OpenAI's Assistant API, and generates personalized book recommendations. The system leverages vector search capabilities to find books that match user interests based on their reading history.

## Features

- **User Reading Analysis**: Analyzes user reading history to identify interests and preferences
- **Personalized Book Recommendations**: Recommends books based on user reading patterns
- **OpenAI Integration**: Uses OpenAI's Assistant API with function calling and vector search
- **Snowflake Database**: Retrieves user reading history and book information from Snowflake
- **Token Usage Tracking**: Monitors OpenAI API token usage and calculates associated costs

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Snowflake account
- OpenAI API key

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/hellojixian/pt-user-reading-analysis-ts.git
   cd pt-user-reading-analysis-ts
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4-turbo-preview
   SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT=your_snowflake_account
   SNOWFLAKE_USER=your_snowflake_username
   SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD=your_snowflake_password
   ```

4. Build the project:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

## Usage

Run the application with:

```
npm start
```

By default, the application processes one user. To process more users, specify the number as an argument:

```
npm start -- 5
```

For development with automatic reloading:

```
npm run dev
```

## How It Works

1. The application connects to Snowflake and retrieves active users who have been reading books.
2. For each user, it fetches their reading history (books they've read).
3. It creates an OpenAI Assistant with a vector store containing the library's book catalog.
4. The user's reading history is analyzed to determine their interests and preferences.
5. Based on this analysis, the system recommends books that match the user's interests.
6. Results are displayed in the console, including book recommendations with reasons.
7. At the end of processing, a summary of token usage and costs is displayed.

## Token Usage Tracking

This application includes a comprehensive token tracking system that monitors OpenAI API usage and calculates the associated costs. This feature helps in understanding the financial impact of using AI for book recommendations.

### Token Tracking Features

- **Per-User Tracking**: Monitors and attributes token usage to specific users
- **Operation-Level Breakdown**: Separates token usage by operation type (interest analysis vs. book recommendations)
- **Cost Calculation**: Converts token usage into financial cost based on current OpenAI pricing
- **Detailed Reporting**: Provides a comprehensive summary report at the end of execution

### Pricing Configuration

The system uses a dedicated configuration file (`src/config/openai_pricing.ts`) that maintains current OpenAI API pricing information. This approach makes it easy to update prices when they change, without modifying the core application code.

Current pricing for GPT-4o (as of March 2025):
- Input tokens: $2.50 per million tokens
- Cached input tokens: $1.25 per million tokens
- Output tokens: $10.00 per million tokens
